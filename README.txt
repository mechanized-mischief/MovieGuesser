This is a movie guessing game. Create a list of movies, with one movie per line,
or use the one included. Then guess letters and see if you can figure out
what movie it is within a certain number of guesses.

To run the program with the included movie list, use the command:

java GuessMovie movieList.txt

Enjoy!
